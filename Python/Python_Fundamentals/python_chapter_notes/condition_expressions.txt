Conditional Expressions

Conditional statements or expressions in Python can be done using if (and else) just like in other programming languages.
We use these conditional statements with logic operators to control the flow of our programs.

            # if statement:
            if <condition>:
              # do something
            # if-else statement:
            elif <condition>:
              # do something
            else:
              # do this instead

Say, for example, you were driving home and there was some construction on the road in front of you.
You notice a detour sign and decide to take that way back instead. Although it was practically a subconscious decision, this illustrates how we use control flow and conditionals in everyday life to determine what we would do based on certain conditions.

Our if-else statement would look like this:
            If there is construction
            {
                 use detour
            }
            else
            {
                 take the normal route
            }

Here's another example but now written out in python code:
            age = 15
            if age >= 18:
              print 'Legal age'
            else:
              print 'You are so young!'

The if and if-else statements in Python are straightforward and are very much like the if statements in other languages.
The only difference with Python's if statement is, when you have another condition, you write it using elif.

            if age >= 18:
              print 'Legal age'
            elif age == 17:
              print 'One more year and you will be of legal age'
            else:
              print 'You are so young!'
Elif is just like else if or elsif from other languages.
