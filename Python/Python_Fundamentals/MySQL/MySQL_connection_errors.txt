1) Deleting quotations on local host:

    File "server.py", line 6, in <module>
      mysql = MySQLConnector(app, 'flasksql')
    File "/Users/Paddie/Desktop/DojoAssignments/Python/Flask_MySQL/flask_mysql/mysqlconnection.py", line 40, in MySQLConnector
      return MySQLConnection(app, db)
    File "/Users/Paddie/Desktop/DojoAssignments/Python/Flask_MySQL/flask_mysql/mysqlconnection.py", line 8, in __init__
      'host': localhost,
    NameError: global name 'localhost' is not defined
    (py2FlaskEnv) Patricks-MacBook-Pro-2:flask_mysql Paddie$

* Anything that is missing a quotation will show error name 'element' is not defined.

2) If port number isn't set according to MAMP SQL port

    File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/MySQLdb/connections.py", line 193, in __init__
      super(Connection, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs2)
    sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (61)")

* Anything port number or ports that are not the same as your MAMP/WAMP SQL port number will show:
                (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (61)")
- Make sure you check your port on MySQL WorkBench and see if your MySQL Connector file's @ Manage Server connection has the port number
needed for changes.

3)  Changing User name other that 'root':

    sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError)
    (1045, "Access denied for user '*****'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")

- anything created outside of the name of root will show the following error representing ***** part.

4) @ rate the path to connect to your sql database
        DATABASE_URI = "mysql://{}:{}@127.0.0.1:
        Changing the IP address to something outside of your ip say:@127.0.0.0:
* it will go into your server mode but now show that:
                                        * Debugger is active!
                                        * Debugger pin code: 297-974-343
                ! BE CAREFUL NOT TO BE FOOLED THAT SERVER WORKS!
