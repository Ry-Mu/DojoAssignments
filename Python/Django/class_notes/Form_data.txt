Form Data

As you’ve already seen, getting information from a user via forms is an extremely important part of web development.
When we were using Flask, we used the form property of the request object to access input values.

Django behaves very similarly, except the property is request.POST if the method that hits the route is a post and request.GET if the method that hits the route is a get.

Key Terms

request.POST -Data from POST request

request.GET - Data from GET request

request.method - Returns the method/HTTP verb associated with the request

{% csrf_token %} - Prevents cross-site request forgery (place it in a form on the HTML/template side of your project)

Session

Now let’s set up to use session!

In our terminal, head to the directory where manage.py resides and run the following commands:

              # Need to be in same directory as manage.py file
              > python manage.py makemigrations
              > python manage.py migrate

Excellent. Not only does that annoying warning you’ve been suffering disappear, but now session is now available to us (as seen in that last line: Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK).

Now we can restart our server and use session:
              request.session # It's a dictionary, so you can attach key/value pairs

Now, let's try out session. In your ./vinmymvc/views.py file, in the create function, add the following:
          request.session['name'] = request.POST['first_name']

And in ./vinmymvc/index.html add the following in a line above your form

            {{request.session.name}}

Useful session methods:

request.session['key'] - This will retrieve (get) the value stored in key

request.session['key'] = 'value' - Set the value that will be stored by key

del request.session['key'] - Deletes a session key if it exists, throws a keyError if it doesn’t. Use along with try and except since it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission

'key' in request.session - Returns a boolean of whether a key is in session or not

{{ request.session.name }} - Use dot notation (.) to access request.session keys from templates since square brackets ([]) aren’t allowed there

Errata note: In the video, we (I, MH) say session behaves the same as it does in Flask. This is not true! Session in Django gets saved even if we leave the browser!
