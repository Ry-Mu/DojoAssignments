Why Pylot MVC

MVC architecture is a way of organizing server-side code to help create robust web applications. You can imagine that creating all of the Python code for a website like Facebook using the procedural techniques that we have learned in the past could get pretty messy.
 By combining OOP with our knowledge of the different web components, we can organize our code to be more modular and we can use an MVC framework to help us.

Most ALL enterprise level web applications are built using an MVC framework and it's CRITICAL that you understand how to build your web application using an MVC framework.

Why are we teaching Pylot?

Pylot is an MVC framework that takes concepts from Rails, CodeIgniter, and Django (three very well known frameworks) and applies them to create a lightweight but powerful framework. Pylot is great for teaching the core concepts that will help you build robust applications in the future. Pylot also has a very small footprint so it is easy to get up and running with it. While using Pylot feel free to look through all of the files and read the comments to better understand what each file is used for. Spend no more than 4 hours going through the core files of the framework.

Objectives

Our objectives are:

Understand what the different components in an MVC framework are and how they interact
Understand the path that an HTTP request goes through in the framework and how the response is generated and returned.
Understand the difference between Procedural code and MVC code and the advantages of both.
Understand how OOP works in the MVC framework
Build a website with MVC framework!
