        <h2> Javascript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript Basics  Javascript is a cross-platform object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is
          extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight
          language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a buch of different directions.
          JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
          it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Variable Delaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing
            data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
            a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
            with unique names. These unique names are called identifies. <span class="important">var x;</span>

          </li>
          <li><a href="#">Variable Assignments</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables
             - out cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value
              to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="important">var x=10;</span>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions
             for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on conditional
              statements: if is a specified condition is true, do this code in our
              code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first
              condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
          </li>
          <li><a href="#">Logos</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
            language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat
            an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well
            you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
          </li>
          <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call
             our functions this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
              instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk
              from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get stated, first
              we screw the legs to the table top, next we place the table the right
              way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more
              tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
